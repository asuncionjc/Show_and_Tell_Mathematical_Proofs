# Show_and_Tell_Mathematical_Proofs

A brief introduction to the concepts related with the mathematical proofs, with special attention on the proofs by 
contradiction and by induction.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to bring Maths closer to the non-mathematicians, emphasizing in the engineers of [Karumi](https://www.karumi.com/).

Any feedback is welcome, üòÑ so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy üò≥ and do not want to

## Abstract

Is Mathematics so difficult as it seems? Are mathematicians so squared-minded as they looked? In this talk, we will learn that is not so complicated to think in a mathematical way.

To this aim, the basic ideas of a mathematical proof will be given and illustrated in two well-known techniques: proof by contradiction and proof by induction. Moreover, we all together will solve some examples to clarify the concepts.

In this talk, no previous knowledge is required. You will just need some paper and a pen to write notes and to be eager to learn.

Note that the source file of the abstract can be found [here](./Abstract/Abstract_show_and_tell.tex), as well as the [pdf document](./Abstract/Abstract_show_and_tell.pdf).

## Contents

The content of this project will be given as a talk. The slides can be checked in the following [link](./Slides/MAJC_show_and_tell.pdf). The talk begins with an introduction to the mathematical reasoning, explaining some basic concepts, such as what is a theorem or a proof. Then, proofs of real theorems are solved by applying the well-known techniques: proof by contradiction and by induction. Finally, some conclusions are provided.
