# Show_and_Tell_Mathematical_Proofs

A brief introduction to the concepts related with the mathematical proofs, with special attention 🧐 on the proofs by 
contradiction ➡️⬅️ and by induction.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to bring Maths ➕➖➗✖️ closer to the non-mathematicians, making special attention to the engineers of [Karumi](https://www.karumi.com/) 👨🏻‍💻.

Any feedback is welcome, 😄 so please feel free to ask or comment anything you want. If you are shy 😳 and do not want to
write in the repo, I will be happy to answer you by email at asuncionjc@us.es 👩🏻‍💻 .

## Abstract

Is Mathematics so difficult as it seems? 🤯 Are mathematicians so squared-minded as they looked? 🔲 In this talk, we will learn that is not so complicated to think 🙄 in a mathematical way.

To this aim, the basic ideas of a mathematical proof will be given and illustrated in two well-known techniques: proof by contradiction and proof by induction. Moreover, we all together will solve some examples ✍🏼 to clarify the concepts.

In this talk, no previous knowledge is required 😃 You will just need some paper 📒 and a pen to write notes ✍🏼 and to be eager to learn 😃💪

Note that the source file of the abstract can be found [here](./Abstract/Abstract_show_and_tell.tex), as well as the [pdf document](./Abstract/Abstract_show_and_tell.pdf).

## Contents

The content of this project will be given as a talk  The slides can be checked in the following  👉🏼 [link](./Slides/MAJC_show_and_tell.pdf) 👈🏼
The talk begins with an introduction to the mathematical reasoning, 🤔 explaining some basic concepts, such as what is a theorem or a proof. Then, proofs of real theorems are solved by applying the well-known techniques: proof by contradiction and by induction. Finally, some conclusions are provided 🙌🏼🙌🏼
