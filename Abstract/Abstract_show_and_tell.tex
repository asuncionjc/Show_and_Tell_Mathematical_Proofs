\title{\bf An Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning with Applications to Induction and Contradiction Proofs}
\author{\Large Asunci\'on Jim\'enez-Cordero} 
    \date{}
  \maketitle
Is Mathematics so difficult as it seems? Are mathematicians so squared-minded as they looked? In this talk, we will learn that is not so complicated to think in a mathematical way.

To this aim, the basic ideas of a mathematical proof will be given and illustrated in two well-known techniques: proof by contradiction and proof by induction. Moreover, we all together will solve some examples to clarify the concepts.

In this talk, no previous knowledge is required. You will just need some paper, a pen to write notes and to be eager to learn.
